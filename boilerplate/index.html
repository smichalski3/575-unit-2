                The World's Most Beloved Art Museums
            </p>

            <p class = "text1"> 
                This project maps many popular art museums globally. 
                Consistently, Musée du Louvre, located in Paris, France, 
                has been the most visited art museum. It houses some of 
                the world’s most famous artwork, including the elusive <b>Mona Lisa</b>
                and the <b>Venus de Milo</b>. Recently, the Musei Vaticani in the 
                Vatican City have been the second-most visited. These museums 
                feature several renowned, quintessential Renaissance masterpieces, 
                such as the <b>School of Athens</b> and the <b>Sistine Chapel</b>. 
            </p>

            <p class = "text2"> 
                The interactive map below is styled after the Gallery of Maps 
                in the Musei Vaticani. This gallery contains a series of painted 
                topographical maps commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII in the late 
                16th century. The walls of the gallery are covered with forty 
                different maps of various Italian regions, and the ceiling above 
                each map illustrates the major religious events of that area. The 
                maps showcase exquisitely beautiful, opulent detail. While this 
                ornamentation may not be possible to recreate as a Mapbox tileset, 
                some of the color palette, font styles, and textures are represented. 
            </p>
            
            <p class = "text1">
                The interactive map also hosts several helpful features. The sequence 
                bar on the left allows one to sequence through 7 different time stamps 
                from 2015-2021. Clicking on each red proportional symbol will call a 
                pop-up with information about that museum. Generally, the data reveal 
                that museum attendance has flourished rapidly over time, only to be 
                majorly halted by many museum closures during the start of the pandemic 
                in 2020. Art museums have since struggled to regain solid visitation numbers. 
                This map data was sourced from the annual reports that these museums have 
                published. Unfortunately, many smaller, less popular museums had to be left 
                off this map, as their reports are not published publicly.
