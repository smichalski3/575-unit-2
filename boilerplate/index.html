                The Baker/Pisano Collection represents the life work of Fred Baker and his late partner, Ronald Pisano. 
                Mr. Baker graduated from UWâ€”Madison in 1959. He began donating items from his collection of American 
                artworks from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the Chazen Museum of Art (the then Elvehjem) 
                in the 1970s. The collection includes early works on paper, monotypes, watercolor miniatures, paintings,
                 and decorative arts, including Arts & Crafts ceramics, that together inform the creation of a national
                school of art in America. Highlights include paintings by Arthur Wesley Dow, Asher B. Durand, George
                 Inness, and Elihu Vedder, and drawings by William Merritt Chase, John Singleton Copley, Winslow Homer,
                  John Marin, John Trumbull, and Benjamin West.

                The permanent collection of Chinese art has been greatly
                expanded thanks to Simon K. Chen, a UW alum, and Rosemary Ho Chen. Their gift of more than 100 works
                includes Chinese calligraphy, painting, woodblock prints, and rubbings, dating from 1692 to 1996. Important
                works include paintings by early Qing artists Zhu Da and Yu Zhiding, and by Republican artists Gao Qifeng
                and Chang Dai-chien. Recent works represent the revival of traditional ink-painting techniques in mainland
                 China after the Cultural Revolution. The paintings depict various subjects, such as landscapes, flowers,
                  birds, and tigers. Styles range from expressionist ink painting to colorful representations, demonstrating
                   how Chinese artists have adapted traditional techniques to modern contexts.
